    "my_story_text": "Passionate about the English language since childhood, I graduated in English Language and Literature from UFMG in 2015, where I also completed a Master's degree in English Language in 2019. My career as a teacher started in 2011. Throughout these 11 years, I have worked in renowned English schools and also taught as an intern at UFMG in different programs. I am grateful for all these opportunities, which have greatly contributed to my training. But in 2017, already with a good professional background, I began to pursue what I knew was my own path: translation, proofreading, and private lessons for adult learners. I have had dozens of private students over all these years, and I have no doubt that I made the choice that best allows me to share my knowledge. Since 2013, I have also worked in translation, proofreading, transcription, and subtitling, having already worked with dozens of documents of various genres. <b>My goal is to ensure that the English language is no longer a problem in your life, and my vocation is to do this with excellence.</b>",

However, each student is a unique combination of learning profile, language goals, previous study experiences, interests, personality, and deadlines. It is impossible for a single method to meet everyone's needs. That's why I <b>don't have a fixed method</b>: I work with a variety of approaches and materials (including my own materials), believe in flexible methodology, and diversified lessons.",
    "desc_2": "Students fill out a form before the start of classes so that I can get to know them better and create an initial study plan. Students who identify themselves as intermediate or advanced speakers take a free placement test to identify the skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) that need more attention. The test will determine the student's CEFR level for each skill. Throughout the course, students are free to give their opinions about the selected activities or suggest a change of course (for example, if a new demand arises, such as a proficiency exam or a trip abroad, etc.) Little by little, we adjust the lessons together to meet the student's needs and interests. Methodologies need to flow because life flows.",

All notes made in class are sent to the student afterwards, along with the materials, so that their only concern is learning. ðŸ˜Š",

Also, the relationship developed with each student throughout the lessons makes the work more personal and human, which is essential for me - I have made true friends teaching English. Furthermore, my diverse professional experience has allowed me to attest, without a doubt, that <b>private students learn faster, better and with more pleasure.</b> I am passionate about the work I do because I believe in it; I am no longer frustrated with the well-known disadvantages of traditional English schools. <b>As a private teacher, I am free to prioritize quality teaching.</b>"
